✨ A clean, declarative way to create WSL instances from a single YAML config, with a focus on clarity and repeatability.

> Status: early/in-development. Some operations are still mock.

---

## ✅ Requirements

WSL must be enabled on Windows before you can create instances. Run this once in an elevated PowerShell:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

Optional: install the latest PowerShell via winget if you prefer a newer shell experience:

```powershell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget
```

---

## ⚡ Quickstart

Download the latest release binary from: 📦

```text
https://github.com/mirai-toto/wslforge/releases
```

Run it with your config: ✅

```sh
./wslforge --config config.yaml
```

Want to preview what will happen without making changes? Use dry-run: 🔍

```sh
./wslforge --config config.yaml --dry-run
```

Need more details for troubleshooting? Increase verbosity: 🧰

```sh
./wslforge -v
./wslforge -vv
```

---

## 🧭 CLI

Common flags:

| Flag             | Description                             | Default       |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `--config`       | Path to YAML config file                | `config.yaml` |
| `--dry-run`      | Show what would be done without changes | `false`       |
| `--debug`        | Enable extra debug output and artifacts | `false`       |
| `--print-config` | Print a minimal example config and exit | `false`       |
| `-v`, `-vv`      | Increase verbosity                      | `0`           |

Print a minimal example config:

```sh
./wslforge --print-config
```

---

## 🛠 Development

Build locally:

```sh
cargo build --release
cp config.template.yaml config.yaml
./target/release/wslforge --config config.yaml
```

Enable the repo githooks and make the hook executable:

```sh
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The pre-commit hook runs `cargo fmt --all`.

---

## 🧩 Configuration

The configuration is intentionally small. Most fields are optional, and you can grow into advanced options as needed.

The top-level config is now a `profiles` map, where each key is a profile name:

```yaml
profiles:
  MyProfile:
    hostname: MyProfile
    username: wsluser
```

Note: a single-profile file without `profiles:` is still accepted for backward compatibility, but the recommended format is the `profiles` map.

Core fields (per profile):

| Field         | Description                               | Example                    | Mandatory |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| `override`    | Replace existing instance if it exists    | `true`                     | ➖        |
| `hostname`    | WSL instance name                         | `UbuntuWslDev`             | ✅        |
| `username`    | Default user                              | `wsluser`                  | ✅        |
| `password`    | Optional password (hashed for cloud-init) | `root`                     | ➖        |
| `install_dir` | Target install directory                  | `%userprofile%/VMs`        | ✅        |
| `http_proxy`  | HTTP proxy URL                            | `http://proxy.local:8080`  | ➖        |
| `https_proxy` | HTTPS proxy URL                           | `https://proxy.local:8443` | ➖        |
| `no_proxy`    | Comma-separated proxy bypass list         | `localhost,127.0.0.1`      | ➖        |

Example `config.yaml` with a file-based cloud-init and an official distro:

```yaml
profiles:
  UbuntuWslDev:
    override: true
    hostname: UbuntuWslDev
    username: wsluser
    password: root

    http_proxy: null
    https_proxy: null
    no_proxy: null

    install_dir: "%userprofile%/VMs"

    cloud_init:
      type: file
      path: "cloud-init.yaml"

    image:
      type: distro
      name: Ubuntu
```

### Cloud init

Use cloud-init to bootstrap packages and settings on first boot. You can reference a file or embed the YAML inline. These blocks live inside a profile.

Cloud-init types:

| Type     | Description                | Example                   |
| -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `file`   | Load user-data from a file | `path: "cloud-init.yaml"` |
| `inline` | Inline YAML user-data      | `content: \| ...`         |

File-based user-data (recommended for larger configs):

```yaml
cloud_init:
  type: file
  path: "cloud-init.yaml"
```

Inline user-data (handy for small, self-contained configs):

```yaml
cloud_init:
  type: inline
  content: |
    #cloud-config
    packages:
      - curl
```

### Image Sources

Pick where the root filesystem comes from: an official WSL distro or a local rootfs archive. These blocks live inside a profile.

Image types:

| Type     | Description                      | Example                               |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `distro` | Install from official WSL distro | `name: Ubuntu`                        |
| `file`   | Import from local rootfs archive | `path: "%USERPROFILE%/Downloads/..."` |

Official WSL distro (simple and quick):

```yaml
image:
  type: distro
  name: Ubuntu
```

Local rootfs archive (for custom or prebuilt images):

```yaml
image:
  type: file
  path: "%USERPROFILE%/Downloads/ubuntu-noble-wsl-amd64-ubuntu.rootfs.tar.gz"
```

## 💡 Rationale

### Why this project exists

- Set up WSL the same way every time using one config file
- No more clicking around or doing steps by hand
- Share your setup with others easily
- Recreate your dev environment in minutes
- Break things safely and rebuild fast

### Why it’s written in Rust

Originally prototyped in **PowerShell**, but moved to **Rust** for long-term reliability and maintainability.

- A single executable is easier for users than running and trusting scripts
- Strong typing and solid tooling make the app more reliable as it grows
- Great ecosystem for CLI apps, config parsing, logging, and testing

### Why it uses cloud-init

Originally provisioned with **Ansible**, but moved to **cloud-init** to better match first-boot, zero-prep environments.

- Simpler model: one config applied automatically at first boot
- Faster path to a ready system since provisioning happens during startup
- No prior network or SSH setup required to begin configuration
- Already included on most modern distros, no extra install step
